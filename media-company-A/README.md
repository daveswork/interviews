This is project I've completed for a leading media company. 

'data-crawl.py' has been tested on Python3.6 with the following libraries:
Pandas: Most of the work can be performed using functions within Pandas.
Json: Individual records are in Json format.
NumPy: Some of NumPy's functions make processing the data faster.
Time: Just to provide the runtime of the entire answer to the dataset. 


Source data is in 'source1.csv' and 'source2.csv'.
