This is project I've completed for a leading media company as part of their interview process.
This got me the onsite interview, however I didn't land the job, boo...

`instructions_fs.txt` contains the requirements. 

`data-crawl.py` has been tested on Python3.6 with the following libraries:
* Pandas: Most of the work can be performed using functions within Pandas.
* Json: Individual records are in Json format.
* NumPy: Some of NumPy's functions make processing the data faster.
* Time: Just to provide the runtime of the entire answer to the dataset. 

The source data stored in `source1.csv` and `source2.csv` needs to be in the same directory as
`data-crawl.py`

To run, after cloning, execute:

`python data-crawl.py`
